# resume
**My Ciriculum Vitae in form of an app**

Few weeks ago I've decided to update my resume, but I couldn't find idea how to make it more interesting and attractive to potential employers. I've decided that I will to what I can do best and created this app.

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wec.resume&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>

Boring old style PDF resume can be found [HERE](https://majfrendmartin.github.io/resume/PawelRaciborskiCV.pdf)
## TODO
It is not by any means a final product. There is a lot of room for inprovment to be honest.
- cover existing code with unit test,
- any further changes should be done with TDD,
- handle resume updates with push notifications
